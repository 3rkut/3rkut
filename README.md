# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 20 years old Malware Researcher from Turkey.

## About Me:
I grew up with computers. I met computers when I was 5.(Casper PC) In highschool, Linux and some malwares really blew my mind.(ZeuS and SpyEye) and I analyzed, tested them. How this malwares coded, who created, what are the methods for infecting to computers. And I really love and interested in all of them. Nowadays I focused on mobile malwares. (Anubis, Exobot, Cerberus, alien, hydra etc..) and their injections methods, communicating methods > c2 via tor or p2p bots.

My plan is currently researching interesting new malwares, crime groups(threat actors) and improve my vx skills.

### Special Interests:
- State sponsored hacker groups(Sandworm, Lazarus etc..) actually all APTs
- Financial motivated groups ( like fin7) and their methods > hvnc, supply chain & watering hole attacks or usbkiller attack :)
- And other nigerians bec scams (public rats and some spam mailer tool stuff)
- Ransomware Groups and RDP access sellers/actors
